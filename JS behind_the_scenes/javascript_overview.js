/*
JavaScript is a high-level, prototype-based,

object-oriented, multi-paradigm,

interpreted or just-in-time compiled,

dynamic, single-threaded,

garbage-collected programming language

with first-class functions

and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model.


Paradigm: an approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct your coding style and technique

three most popular  paradigm are :

procedural programming : this what we have been doing so far which is basically just organizing the code in a very linear way and with some functions in between


object oriented programming: almost everything in js is an object except for primitive values such as numbers strings etc

functional programming

we can also classify paradigm as imperative or declarative

javascript is a language with first class functions : that is functions are treated as regular variables so we can pass functions into other functions and we can even return functions from functions and this allows functional programming


Next, I said that JavaScript is a dynamic language

and dynamic actually means dynamically-typed.

So as we've already seen,

in JavaScript, we don't assign data types to variables.

Instead, they only became known

when the JavaScript engine executes our code.

Also, the type of variables can easily be changed

as we reassign variables.

And this is basically what dynamically-typed means.


concurrency model: how the js engine handles multiple tasks happeing at the same time
